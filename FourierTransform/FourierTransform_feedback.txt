Problem 2 (5 points):
Score += 5

Problem 3 (5 points):
Embed the note like you did in problem 2
Score += 0

Problem 4 (5 points):
Embed the note like you did in problem 2

Problem 5 (5 points):
Use np.allclose() to print true or false if your function matches sccipy's fft
Score += 4

Problem 6 (10 points):
Use np.allclose() to print true or false if your function matches scyipy's fft. Your array should be 8192 random samples. You should also time both of your dft and fft functions and scipy's fft function
Score += 3

Problem 7 (5 points):
DFT plots are good, but sound wave plots don't look right
